 * again", "gate: the base branch moves" and "gate: the decision that the gate passed is in the
 * ledger" and "gate: required CI checks". Left out, for the issues that own them: the re-gate of a
 * `pr-open` pull request and the legacy worktree sweep (#23), and the `.dw/config.yml` refusal of a
 * repo with `project_config` (the fork has none). The end of a run from #20 (a closed issue, a
 * stop by hand) is at the end of the file. The results comment's own tests are in `gate.test.ts`.
