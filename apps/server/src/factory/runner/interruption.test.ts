 * Interruptions and relaunches, ported from softfac's `runner/tests/interruption.rs` and

 * interruption (a resume into the same thread, or a relaunch from the run's branch) or a stop.
 * Left out, for the issue that owns them (#24): everything in `interruption.rs` that reads pull
 * request feedback into a paused thread (`paused_with_pr` and the `feedback_forwarding` and
 * owed-feedback tests after it).
